        "description": "Create a basic component or endpoint to perform a simple system health check and verify core functionality.",
        "details": "Implement a minimal component, such as a '/health' endpoint or a simple function call within the application's entry point, that performs basic checks. These checks should include verifying database connectivity (if applicable) and ensuring the application starts without critical errors. The implementation should be lightweight and serve as the initial confirmation that the system environment and basic setup are functional. Consider logging the outcome of the checks.",
        "testStrategy": "Access the implemented health check endpoint or execute the test function directly. Verify that the response indicates a successful status (e.g., HTTP 200 OK for an endpoint, a specific return value for a function) and that any relevant logs confirm successful checks (like database connection). Ensure no errors are reported during the execution of the test component.",
